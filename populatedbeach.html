    <h3> Many times, populated beaches are dangerous for wildlife due to unsupervised interactions between human and wildlife.</h3>
    <h3> Dog attacks are a common problem for many creatures, especially the Piping Plover, whose nests are simple dips in the sand. The conflicts between wildlife and pets, people, and vehicles are one of the leading causes of habitat loss for this bird, bringing it closer to extinction. Luckily, in this scenario, you have the ability to go back and continue on your migration path.  </h3>
