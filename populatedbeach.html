    <h2>Your nest was attacked by a dog</h2>

    <h3> Many times, populated beaches are dangerous grounds for wildlife due to unsupervised interactions between human and wildlife.</h3>
    <h3> Dog attacks are a common problem for many creatues, espcially the Piping Plover. Dogs, humans, etc. can be very dangerous and harmful 
        when coming in contact with wildlife for this reason.  Luckily, in this scenario, you have the ability to go back and continue on your migration path.  </h3>
