       <h4> Piping plovers often choose to nest in the Gulf of Mexico because of the great sand flats. <br> During your time at the Gulf of Mexico, you will need
        to find food, a safe place to lay eggs, <br>and defend your eggs from the predators that may exist near you. </h4>
        <h4> For now, it's just time to find 
            something to eat.<br><br></h4>
