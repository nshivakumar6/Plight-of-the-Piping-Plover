    <h1>Oh no!</h1>
    <h2>You accidentally ate plastic!</h2>

    <h3> The juicy worm you thought you spotted turned out to be a piece of plastic trash.</h3>
    <h3> This is a common problem for marine life today. Oftentimes, many animals mistake food for plastic or ingest food that is covered
        with microplastics. Luckily, in this scenario, you have the ability to go back and continue on your migration path.  </h3>
