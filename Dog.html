        Uh-oh--There's a dog coming!!
    </h1>
    <p>
        You and your chicks had just settled down into your new nest, when you hear a barking dog running towards you!
    </p>
    <div  id="bird">
            <img src="media/images/defending_the_nest.jpg" class="main-bird" />
    </div>
    <p>
        In a last-ditch attempt to protect your new nest, you pretend to limp with a broken wing to distract the dog from your chicks.
